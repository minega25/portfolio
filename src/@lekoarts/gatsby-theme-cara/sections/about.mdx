### About me

I am a professional full-stack software developer with 2 years of experience building software solutions for top leading technology firms in Africa. I was part of a highly dynamic team that built internal software products that reduced both capital and operation expenditure.

I have horned my software development craft for 5 years now, and I believe technology is my ultimate passion. I have a deep understanding of the Javascript programming language which allows me to build for mobile, web, and server-side technologies.
